# Resource (eventstorecloud_managed_cluster)

Manages EventStoreDB instances and clusters in Event Store Cloud

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/managed_cluster/example_1.tf"}}

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->

## Schema

### Required

- **disk_size** (Number) Size of the data disks, in gigabytes
- **disk_type** (String) Storage class of the data disks (find the list of valid values below)
- **instance_type** (String) Instance type of the managed cluster (find the list of valid values below). A different instance type will trigger a resize operation.
- **name** (String) Name of the managed cluster
- **network_id** (String) ID of the network in which the managed cluster exists
- **project_id** (String) ID of the project in which the managed cluster exists
- **server_version** (String) Server version to provision (find the list of valid values below)
- **topology** (String) Topology of the managed cluster (`single-node` or `three-node-multi-zone`)

### Optional

- **disk_iops** (Number) Number of IOPS for storage, required if disk_type is `gp3`
- **disk_throughput** (Number) Throughput in MB/s for storage, required if disk_type is `gp3`
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **projection_level** (String) Determines whether to run no projections, system projections only, or system and user projections (find the list of valid values below) Defaults to `off`.
- **protected** (Boolean) Protection from an accidental cluster deletion Defaults to `false`.
- **server_version_tag** (String) Server version tag to provision (find the list of valid values below). A higher server_version_tag will prompt an upgrade.

### Read-Only

- **dns_name** (String) DNS address of the cluster
- **region** (String) Region in which the cluster was created. Determined by the region of the Network
- **resource_provider** (String) Provider in which the cluster was created. Determined by the provider of the Network.

### Valid Values

Use only the following values as `disk_type`:

| Provider     | Disk types        |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| Azure        | `premium-ssd-lrs` |
| Google Cloud | `ssd`             |
| AWS          | `gp2`, `gp3`      |

For `server_version`, use one of the available EventStoreDB product versions:
- `20.10`
- `21.10`
- `22.6`
- `22.10`
- `23.6`
- `23.10`
- `24.2`
- `24.6`

For `projection_level`, use one of the following values:
- `off` (the projections subsystem is disabled completely)
- `system` (only run system projections)
- `user` (both system and custom JavaScript projections are enabled)

Use one of the available instance types as `instance_type`:

Small-scale:
- `F1`
- `C4`

Production scale:
- `M8`
- `M16`
- `M32`
- `M64`
- `M128`

Check our [instance size guide](https://developers.eventstore.com/cloud/provision/cloud-instance-guidance/) to choose the right size for your workload.

Use one of the following values as `topology`:
- `single-node`
- `three-node-multi-zone`

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:
