# Resource (eventstorecloud_integration_awscloudwatch_metrics)

Manages integrations for AwsCloudWatch metrics.

**NOTE**: This functionality is currently in beta. To access it please contact support.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/integration_awscloudwatch_metrics/example_1.tf"}}

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->

## Schema

### Required

- **cluster_ids** (List of String) Clusters to be used with this integration
- **description** (String) Human readable description of the integration
- **namespace** (String) Name of the CloudWatch namespace
- **project_id** (String) ID of the project to which the integration applies
- **region** (String) AWS region for group

### Optional

- **access_key_id** (String, Sensitive) AWS IAM access key
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **secret_access_key** (String, Sensitive) AWS IAM secret access key

## IAM Credentials and Security Implications

It is recommended you create credentials especially for use with this resource which have extremely limited access. A good example is shown in the snippet above, where the `aws_iam_user` resource only has permissions to put metric data into the given AWS CloudWatch namespace.

While is it possible to use the `eventstorecloud_integration` resource with a sink property of `awsCloudWatchMetrics`, it is recommended to use the `eventstorecloud_integration_awscloudwatch_metrics` resource instead as the IAM credentials get marked as sensitive to Terraform and will not be shown when running steps such as `terraform plan`.

Even then, the IAM credentials given to this resource will be stored in the Terraform raw state as plain-text. More information on sensitive data in Terraform state can be read [here](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/sensitive-data).
