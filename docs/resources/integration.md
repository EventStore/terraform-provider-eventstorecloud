- **description** (String) Human readable description of the integration
- **project_id** (String) ID of the project to which the integration applies

### Optional

- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.

### Data Properties

- **source** (String) Can be either `issues` or `notifications`. See [here](https://developers.eventstore.com/cloud/integrations/#integration-sources) for information on the types of integration sources
- **sinks** (String) The type of this value determines the acceptable settings for `source` as well as what other properties are allowed in this field. See [here](https://developers.eventstore.com/cloud/integrations/#integration-sinks) for information on integration sinks

#### OpsGenie Data Properties

OpsGenie currently only supports the "issues" source. See [here](https://developers.eventstore.com/cloud/integrations/opsgenie.html#how-to-create-an-api-key) for more info on creating OpsGenie integrations.

- **api_key** (String) A secret key required to integrate with OpsGenie.

~> The `api_key` value is considered private and so is NOT ever returned by the Event Store Cloud API. For that reason it is impossible to display it as a Terraform output value.

Slack currently only supports the "issues" and "notification" sources. See [here](https://developers.eventstore.com/cloud/integrations/slack.html) for more info on creating Slack integrations

- **channel_id** (String) The channel in Slack that messages will be sent. See [here](https://developers.eventstore.com/cloud/integrations/slack.html) for more info. Can be retrieved as an output value.
- **token** (String) A secret token required to integrate with Slack.

~> The `token` value is considered private and so is NOT ever returned by the Event Store Cloud API. For that reason it is impossible to display it as a Terraform output value.
