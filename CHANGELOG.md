# 1.5.17 (June 30, 2022)

Enhancements:

- Two new resources have been added: `integration_awscloudwatch_logs` and `integration_awscloudwatch_metrics`. Both can be used with the two new integration sinks targetting Aws CloudWatch which are currently in Beta

# 1.5.16 (June 29, 2022)

Fixes:

- Changing an eventstorecloud_managed_cluster resource's `disk_type` value would cause the apply to fail. This has been fixed so now disk-expand is called as expected and updates the cluster in place.
- Similarly the eventstorecloud_managed_cluster resource fields `disk_ips` and `disk_throughput` were not being passed correctly during updates. This has also been fixed.

# 1.5.15 (May 18, 2022)

# 1.5.13 (April 25, 2022)

Fixes:

- Server version `20.6` is now allowed again. While 20.6 cannot be used when creating new clusters, existing resources may already be using it, thus this plugin must allow it to avoid raising validation errors on otherwise innocuous actions such as "terraform plan"

# 1.5.12 (April 11, 2022)

Enhancements:

- Support added for gp3 disk types in AWS clusters, which includes the ability to set iops and throughput parameters

- General documentation and example improvements
- Improved error messages for peering resources in a defunct state
- Improved error messages for project data source
- Cluster names can now be updated

# 1.5.7 (September 2, 2021)

Enhancements:

- `resource/eventstorecloud_peering`: `provider_metadata` had been inadvertently changed into a set of maps. It's now back to being a map like before.
