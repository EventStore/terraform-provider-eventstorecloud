# 1.5.25  (September 22, 2023)

Changes:

* Allow server version "23.6" for managed clusters

# 1.5.24  (August 17, 2023)

Changes:

* Add an ability to protect a cluster from removal

# 1.5.22  (January 11, 2023)

Changes:

* Allow server version "22.10" for managed clusters.

# 1.5.21 (November 18, 2022)

Changes:

* `resource/eventstorecloud_peering` : `routes` prefix length is now allowed to be up to 28 instead of 27.

# 1.5.20 (September 8, 2022)

Changes:

* Allow server version "22.6" for managed clusters.

# 1.5.19 (August 4, 2022)

Changes:

* The provider is now built with Go version 1.18
* Versions of CI tools needed to release the code have been updated to overcome regressions.

# 1.5.18 (August 1, 2022)

Fixes:

* The documentation generation process is now fixed after having been broken by the previous release. The docs themselves have minor changes and improvements.

# 1.5.17 (June 30, 2022)

Enhancements:

* Two new resources have been added: `integration_awscloudwatch_logs` and `integration_awscloudwatch_metrics`. Both can be used with the two new integration sinks targetting Aws CloudWatch which are currently in Beta 

# 1.5.16 (June 29, 2022)

Fixes:

* Changing an eventstorecloud_managed_cluster resource's `disk_type` value would cause the apply to fail. This has been fixed so now disk-expand is called as expected and updates the cluster in place.
* Similarly the eventstorecloud_managed_cluster resource fields `disk_ips` and `disk_throughput` were not being passed correctly during updates. This has also been fixed.

# 1.5.15 (May 18, 2022)

Enhancements:

* Added the ability to configure esoteric auth options

# 1.5.14 (April 27, 2022)

Enhancements:

* Added the ability to bypass local validation checks by setting the environment variable `ESC_BYPASS_VALIDATION`

# 1.5.13 (April 25, 2022)

Fixes:

* Server version `20.6` is now allowed again. While 20.6 cannot be used when creating new clusters, existing resources may already be using it, thus this plugin must allow it to avoid raising validation errors on otherwise innocuous actions such as "terraform plan"

# 1.5.12 (April 11, 2022)

Enhancements:

* Support added for gp3 disk types in AWS clusters, which includes the ability to set iops and throughput parameters

# 1.5.11 (January 19, 2022)

Enhancements:

* Allow server version "21.10" for managed clusters

# 1.5.10 (November 1, 2021)

* It's now possible to destroy defunct peering resources
* Updating a peering resource no longer causes the provider to enter into a loop

Enhancements:
* Add documentation for eventstorecloud_network data source
* Update documentation for eventstorecloud_project data source

# 1.5.8 (October 12, 2021)

Enhancements:

* Import functionality has been added for all resources
* Added a data source for networks
* General documentation and example improvements
* Improved error messages for peering resources in a defunct state
* Improved error messages for project data source
* Cluster names can now be updated

# 1.5.7 (September 2, 2021)

Enhancements:

* `resource/eventstorecloud_peering`: `provider_metadata` had been inadvertently changed into a set of maps. It's now back to being a map like before.

# 1.5.6 (August 4, 2021)

Enhancements:

* Allow server version "21.6" for managed clusters

* `resource/eventstorecloud_managed_cluster`: `disk_size` can now be updated to expand the disk size of a cluster. ([#6](https://github.com/EventStore/terraform-provider-eventstorecloud/pull/6))
* `resource/eventstorecloud_managed_cluster`: deleted managed clusters are correctly removed from state. ([#6](https://github.com/EventStore/terraform-provider-eventstorecloud/pull/6))
* `resource/eventstorecloud_network`: deleted networks are correctly removed from state. ([#6](https://github.com/EventStore/terraform-provider-eventstorecloud/pull/6))
* `resource/eventstorecloud_peering`: `provider_metadata` now contains `gcp_project_name` and `gcp_project_id`. `gcp_project_id` is suitable for passing to `google_compute_network_peering` resources. ([#6](https://github.com/EventStore/terraform-provider-eventstorecloud/pull/6))
* `resource/eventstorecloud_peering`: deleted peerings are correctly removed from state. ([#6](https://github.com/EventStore/terraform-provider-eventstorecloud/pull/6))
